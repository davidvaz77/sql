# Assignment 1: Design a Logical Model

## Question 1
Create a logical model for a small bookstore. ðŸ“š

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. Include a date table. There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [_Draw.io_](https://www.drawio.com/) or [_LucidChart_](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

## Question 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

## Question 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2?

_Hint, search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions._

Bonus: Are there privacy implications to this, why or why not?
```
Your answer...
```
There are two options when it comes to storing the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table. 
	A type 1 SCD (Overwrite) which will overwrite the address everytime it is changed. This method will ensure that the information is most current and will save space. 
	Type 2 SCD (Retain Historic Changes) on the other hand will ensure that every historical address is stored. It is more comprehensive but will also take more storage space. 
	
	There are privacy implication: 
	Type 2 will save historic data which may bring up privacy concerns for users. For this, user consent to collect and save data will have to be implemented. 

## Question 4
Review the AdventureWorks Schema [here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LMu4W.gif)

Highlight at least two differences between it and your ERD. Would you change anything in yours?
```
Your answer...
```
The differences between the AdventureWorks Schema and mine are: 
- AW is significantly more extensive (more columns, split by department) 
- There is a dbo schema to capture metadata and sys information 
- Great use of surrogate keys vs my generally more elementary usage
